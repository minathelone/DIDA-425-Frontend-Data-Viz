# Pictorial Charts: Height Comparison
The Pictorial Chart, specifically for comparing the height of two different objects, uses vector images to visualize data.

 Setting up:
The attached code has already provided a sample of how you can edit the axes units, replace SVG paths, and add new objects to the graph.

Replacing Images:
Once you have your vector path ready, use the [SVG Path Editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) to crop and resize the image so that it fits the height of the object.
